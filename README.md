## How It Works

1. **Trigger Activation:**
   - A **push button press** or **loud sound** activates the transistor, pulling the MOSFET gate low, which powers the Arduino.

2. **Timed Operation:**
   - Arduino boots up and runs the code.
   - An **LED lights up** to indicate the ON state.
   - After 10 seconds, the Arduino pulls a pin LOW, turning OFF its own power.

3. **Auto Shut-Off:**
   - The Arduino loses power and turns OFF completely until the next trigger.

## Power Saving Feature

This project saves power by:

- Only turning ON when needed (sound or button trigger)
- Running for a short, fixed time (10 seconds)
- Automatically turning OFF using a MOSFET switch

Ideal for battery-powered systems or sensor-based automation that only needs short bursts of activity.

## Future Enhancements

- Show countdown on OLED display
- Store last activation time in  EEPROM
- Add relay for higher voltage loads
